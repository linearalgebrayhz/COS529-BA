Some problems related to BA Assignment

1. SO(3) condition during optimization
    why updating $\psi$ with $\psi = \psi + \delta\psi$ would result in non SO(3) matrix? (Even generating rotation matrix with Rodrigues formula)

2. Is it necessary to project the rotation matrix to SO(3) after each update. I used SVD.

3. Exceeding time limit with large testcase, `obelisk.pickle`

4. is dictionary efficient to store block diagonal matrices
